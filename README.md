## Features of the application

* You can get a random cocktail with its name, ingredients, image and recipe by clicking on the "My random cocktail" button. This is a cocktail card altogether.

* You can save one if you click on "Add to my favorits" button and then it will be saved in the server side which was made with node.js by myself.

* You cannot save one cocktail more than once. If you try an alert will show up.

* The saved list of your favorit cocktails will appear if you page is loaded.

* You can also delete items from the saved list by clicking on the trash icon next to an item.
